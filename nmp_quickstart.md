Quick Start
Take off the three rack covers (top, front and back) and store them safely while using the unit. Mind that the clamps bend easily which will make it hard to put the covers back on. They should not be exposed to pressure.
Connect the ethernet cable (20) to the computer’s ethernet PCI card and to the desired network.
Set up the screens needed. Normally this includes the canvas (8) with the projector (3), a performer monitor (6) showing the received video and a computer monitor (7) for the NMP rack engineer. Connect these to the computer’s GPU using the included HDMI (16) and DisplayPort (17) cables.
Mount the camera (4) on the stand (5) and connect with active USB cable (14) to the USB 3.0 PCI card on the computer. Use extension (15) only if repositioning the setup is impossible.
Connect the main outputs of the mixer (9) to a pair of speakers using XLR cables. Alternatively use headphones by connecting to the headphone amplifier (24).
Connect the power supply and make sure the power switch is turned on.
Turn on the computer power supply on the back and then turn the computer. Computer mouse (12) needs to be turned on (and off after use) and computer keyboard (11) turns on automatically. They are both located in the rack drawer.
Enter password located under the keyboard.
Turn off antivirus software and firewall.
Open LoLa/JackTrip and check connection. List of frequently used IP addresses is located on the desktop.
Connect and tune LoLa/JackTrip settings to the network.
